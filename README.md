## Overview

_**Closer Look**_ is a website that allows users to dive deeper into information about brands when shopping online, in order to increase awareness of social and environmental side-effects associated with purchases by displaying info related to brands' ethical actions when viewing their products.

### Team Members

Created, designed, and developed by [Darnycya Smith](https://github.com/darnycya), [Alex Beckerman](https://github.com/alexbaldman), [Calliope Jimenez-Clark](https://github.com/NocturnalMusing) and [Pete Du Beau](https://github.com/peterdubeau) (Git Czar / Commitssioner) for General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive's (May '20 Cohort: Constellations) Unit 3 Group Project.

### Team Expectations

Team values and expectations can be found on our project's [Group Expectation Setting Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRMA-V0f6PnXBNkURLLVefh6L5--xXHlyZA2i2bn4hg/edit).

## MVP

_The goal for our **Closer Look** MVP is for users to be able to create an account by providing their e-mail address, name & password, and to be able to save, update, or delete their account information for future use of the site._

<br>

### Goals

- _Create a user 'log-in / sign-up' page in order to create a new account, or log-in to an account if one already exists._
- _Create a user profile page with CRUD features._
- _Use CSS for styling of all pages._

### Client (Front End)

#### Wireframes

[Site Wireframes on Zeplin](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5ef50be43a1c1da368f2178d/dashboard?sid=5ef50d3cdef8c09dd98bcf3e)

- The teamâ€™s Zeplin file of the mock-ups and frameworks of the website.


#### Component Hierarchy

- Within the folder for the overall application, our frontend will be built with ReactJS and will be held in the 'client' folder.  

- Inside the 'client' folder, the folder 'src' will contain our components, screens, and any assets used to make up the app's frontend, and will be structured as per below:

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Login
      |__ UserEdit
      |__ UserCreate           
      |__ UserProfile

## Post-MVP

- _Have working generic controller actions for full-CRUD using Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB in order to implement user / password functions and store product and user data._
- _Create an API of objects representing products for sale, and users of the site._
- _Create a React app with components to be displayed within each screen, allowing users to view products while displaying information about each product's brand and their potential impact on/relationship to social and environmental issues and causes._

## Code Showcase

> This section will contain brief code snippets of functionality we are proud of, along with a brief description.  For example, if you look very closely, LoginSignUp has been Very Strategically Capitalized.


## Code Issues & Resolutions

> This section will catalog any major issues encountered and their resolution.  For example, LoginSignUp continues to be Very Strategically CapitaliZed. ;-)
